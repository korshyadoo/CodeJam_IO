 The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T test cases follow. Each test case begins with a line containing a single integer N: the number of the tribes attacking the Wall. N lines follow, each describing one tribe. The ith line contains eight integers di, ni, wi, ei, si, delta_di, delta_pi and delta_si separated by spaces, describing a single nomadic tribe:

    di – the day of the tribe's first attack (where 1st January, 250BC, is considered day 0)
    ni – the number of attacks from this tribe
    wi, ei – the westmost and eastmost points respectively of the Wall attacked on the first attack
    si – the strength of the first attack
    delta_di – the number of days between subsequent attacks by this tribe
    delta_pi – the distance this tribe travels to the east between subsequent attacks (if this is negative, the tribe travels to the west)
    delta_si – the change in strength between subsequent attacks
